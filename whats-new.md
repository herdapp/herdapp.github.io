# What's New

A lot has changed since we first launched! Here is a quick update on what is new with Herd:

### Herds 
 - Say hello to our newest feature! Each week, we place you in a herd (aka a group chat) of people that share 2-3 of your interests! 
 - Should you enjoy your group, you have until the end of the week to save the herd and keep chatting! 

### Feed
 - The feed is fully focused on discovery, showing you pics from people that share your interests 
 - The feed is chronological
 - The pics on My Herd expire after one week
 - All comments on pics are private

### Profile
 - Profiles have been refreshed, showing your interests and the photos you have posted over the last week
 - All pics and profiles on herd are public

### Pic Feedback
 - We removed emotion-button feedback, as we want to focus on conversations over buttons based interations 
 - The creator of a pic can respond to comments left by other Herd members
 - A tap on someone's profile pic will bring up their public profile and allow you to add them to your Herd

### Notifications
 Notifications have been added to the app which can:
 - alert you when other Herd members comment on a pic you've uploaded
 - alert you when other Herd members respond to one of your comments
 - option to receive Daily Positive Reminders as push notifications

### Navigation
There is now a side navigation where you can:
 - See your profile, edit your interests, change your settings and share herd to your friends!
