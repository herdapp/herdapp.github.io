# What's New #

A lot has changed since we first launched! Here is a quick update on what is new with Herd:

### Homepage ###
 - The Homepage has become more dynamic, with quotes that are updated daily.

### Feed ###
 - The feed is now split between Inspo and My Herd
 - The My Herd feed is a chronological feed based on who you are following
 - The images on My Herd expire after 48 hours
 - Captions and comments show up below each image on both Inspo and My Herd

### Image Feedback ###
 - Tapping an image displays the poster of the image and the category of the image
 - Tapping an image also displays a button that allows a user to flag the image
 - You can share feedback on an image through commenting or through emotion-based feedback buttons
 - Emotion-button feedback is shared with the creator of an image 24 hours after posting
 - The creator of an image can respond to comments left by other Herd members
 - A tap on someone's profile photo will bring up their public profile and allow you to add them to your Herd

### Notifications ###
 Notifications have been added to the app which can:
 - alert you when other Herd members comment on an image you've posted
 - alert you when other Herd members respond to one of your comments
 - option to receive Daily Positive Reminders as push notifications

### Profile ###
