# What's New

A lot has changed since we first launched! Here is a quick update on what is new with Herd:

### Homepage
 - The Homepage has become more dynamic, with quotes and affirmations that are updated daily

### Feed
 - The feed is now split between Inspo and My Herd
 - The My Herd feed is a chronological feed from creators that you add to your Herd
 - The pics on My Herd expire after 48 hours
 - Captions and comments show up below each pic on both Inspo and My Herd

### Pic Feedback
 - Tapping a pic displays the creator of the pic and the category of the pic
 - Tapping a pic also displays a button that allows a user to flag the pic
 - You can share feedback on a pic through commenting or through emotion-based feedback buttons
 - Emotion-button feedback is shared with the creator of a pic 24 hours after uploading
 - The creator of a pic can respond to comments left by other Herd members
 - A tap on someone's profile pic will bring up their public profile and allow you to add them to your Herd

### Notifications
 Notifications have been added to the app which can:
 - alert you when other Herd members comment on a pic you've uploaded
 - alert you when other Herd members respond to one of your comments
 - option to receive Daily Positive Reminders as push notifications

### Profile
 - Profiles now have the option for a public view
 - Up to 15 pics can be selected to share publicly with other Herd members
 - In addition to sharing pics, you can now set a public bio and share your pronouns
